# Hellcat
ESP32 Autonomous Hybrid Vehicle (“Hellcat”)
Technologies: C++, ESP32, BLE, HTML5/JavaScript, Ultrasonic Sensors
- Engineered a dual-mode robotic vehicle capable of switching seamlessly between manual Blue-
tooth control and autonomous navigation.
- Developed a “Smart Reverse” algorithm using comparative logic on rear sensors to autonomously
detect open paths and steer the vehicle into clear zones during obstacle evasion.
- Implemented a 5-sensor array for full 180-degree frontal coverage and blind-spot monitoring to
prevent collisions.
